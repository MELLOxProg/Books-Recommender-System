## What is Collaborative Filtering?

**Collaborative Filtering (CF)** is a method of making automatic predictions about interests by collecting preferences from many users. The underlying assumption is that if users A and B have similar preferences in the past, they will have similar preferences in the future.

## üîç Types of Collaborative Filtering

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="üë• User-Based CF" icon="users">
    **"Users like you also liked..."**
    
    Finds users with similar preferences and recommends items they liked
  </Card>
  <Card title="üìö Item-Based CF" icon="book">
    **"Items similar to what you liked..."**
    
    Finds items similar to those the user has liked in the past
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Our Book Recommender System primarily uses **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**, which tends to be more stable and interpretable for book recommendations.

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

### User-Item Matrix

The foundation of collaborative filtering is the **user-item interaction matrix**:

```python path=null start=null
# Simplified representation
user_item_matrix = pd.DataFrame({
    'User_1': [5, 0, 4, 0, 3],
    'User_2': [4, 0, 0, 2, 4], 
    'User_3': [0, 5, 0, 3, 0],
    'User_4': [0, 4, 0, 4, 0],
    'User_5': [2, 0, 1, 0, 5]
}, index=['Book_A', 'Book_B', 'Book_C', 'Book_D', 'Book_E'])
```

Where:
- **Rows**: Items (books)
- **Columns**: Users  
- **Values**: Ratings (1-10 scale, 0 = no rating)

### Cosine Similarity

We use **cosine similarity** to measure item relationships:

<Note>
**Cosine Similarity Formula:**

For items i and j with rating vectors **v_i** and **v_j**:

```
similarity(i,j) = cos(Œ∏) = (v_i ¬∑ v_j) / (||v_i|| √ó ||v_j||)
```

Where:
- **v_i ¬∑ v_j** = dot product of vectors
- **||v_i||** = magnitude (L2 norm) of vector v_i
- **Œ∏** = angle between vectors
</Note>

### Why Cosine Similarity?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="üìä Handles Sparse Data Well">
    Most user-item matrices are sparse (many missing ratings). Cosine similarity works effectively with sparse vectors by ignoring zero values.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="üéØ Pattern-Focused">
    Measures the **angle** between rating vectors rather than absolute values, focusing on rating patterns rather than magnitude.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="üìè Normalized Scale">
    Results range from -1 (opposite) to 1 (identical), providing intuitive similarity scores.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="‚ö° Computationally Efficient">
    Optimized implementations can handle large sparse matrices efficiently.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Loading">
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Load the three main datasets
    books = pd.read_csv('data/BX-Books.csv', sep=';', encoding='latin-1')
    users = pd.read_csv('data/BX-Users.csv', sep=';', encoding='latin-1') 
    ratings = pd.read_csv('data/BX-Book-Ratings.csv', sep=';', encoding='latin-1')
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Quality Filtering">
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Filter books with sufficient ratings (50+)
    book_rating_count = ratings.groupby('ISBN').count()['Book-Rating']
    popular_books = book_rating_count[book_rating_count >= 50].index

    # Filter active users (200+ ratings)
    user_rating_count = ratings.groupby('User-ID').count()['Book-Rating']  
    active_users = user_rating_count[user_rating_count >= 200].index

    # Apply filters
    filtered_ratings = ratings[
        (ratings['ISBN'].isin(popular_books)) & 
        (ratings['User-ID'].isin(active_users))
    ]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Data Integration">
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Merge with book metadata
    final_rating = filtered_ratings.merge(
        books[['ISBN', 'Book-Title', 'Book-Author', 'Image-URL-L']], 
        on='ISBN', 
        how='left'
    )
    
    # Clean and standardize
    final_rating = final_rating.drop_duplicates(['User-ID', 'Book-Title'])
    final_rating.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Matrix Creation">
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Create pivot table (user-item matrix)
    book_pivot = final_rating.pivot_table(
        index='Book-Title',
        columns='User-ID', 
        values='Book-Rating'
    ).fillna(0)
    
    # Convert to sparse format for memory efficiency
    from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
    book_sparse = csr_matrix(book_pivot.values)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Algorithm

Our system uses **k-NN with cosine similarity** for finding similar books:

```python path=null start=null
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

# Initialize k-NN model
model = NearestNeighbors(
    algorithm='brute',    # Exact search for accuracy
    metric='cosine',      # Cosine similarity  
    n_jobs=-1            # Use all CPU cores
)

# Fit the model
model.fit(book_pivot)
```

#### Algorithm Parameters:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="algorithm='brute'">
    **Brute Force Search**
    - Compares every book with every other book
    - Guarantees finding exact nearest neighbors
    - Slower but more accurate than approximate methods
    - Suitable for our dataset size (~11,000 books)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="metric='cosine'">
    **Cosine Distance Metric**
    - Uses cosine similarity for distance calculation
    - Optimal for sparse, high-dimensional data
    - Focuses on rating patterns rather than absolute values
    - Range: 0 (identical) to 1 (completely different)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="n_neighbors=6">
    **Number of Neighbors**
    - Finds 6 most similar books (including the query book itself)
    - Returns 5 recommendations (excluding the input book)
    - Balances diversity and similarity in results
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Recommendation Generation

When a user selects a book, the system:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Book Lookup">
    ```python path=/C/Users/Nirav/Desktop/rs project/Books-Recommender-System/app.py start=39
    book_id = np.where(book_pivot.index == book_name)[0][0]
    ```
    
    Finds the book's position in the pivot table matrix
  </Step>

  <Step title="Similarity Search">
    ```python path=/C/Users/Nirav/Desktop/rs project/Books-Recommender-System/app.py start=40
    distance, suggestion = model.kneighbors(
        book_pivot.iloc[book_id,:].values.reshape(1,-1), 
        n_neighbors=6
    )
    ```
    
    Uses k-NN to find 6 most similar books based on user rating patterns
  </Step>

  <Step title="Result Processing">
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Extract book indices (excluding the input book)
    similar_books = suggestion[0][1:]  # Skip first result (input book)
    
    # Get book names and metadata
    recommended_books = [book_pivot.index[i] for i in similar_books]
    ```
    
    Converts indices back to book titles and retrieves metadata
  </Step>
</Steps>

</AccordionGroup>

## üî¨ Advanced Concepts

### Matrix Factorization Alternative

While our system uses k-NN, **matrix factorization** is another powerful collaborative filtering approach:

```python path=null start=null
from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD

# Alternative approach: Matrix Factorization
svd = TruncatedSVD(n_components=50, random_state=42)
user_factors = svd.fit_transform(book_pivot.T)  # User embeddings
book_factors = svd.components_.T                # Book embeddings

# Calculate similarity using learned embeddings  
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
book_similarity = cosine_similarity(book_factors)
```
