## What is the Book Recommender System?

The Book Recommender System is an intelligent machine learning application that provides personalized book recommendations using **collaborative filtering**. Built with modern ML algorithms and deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application, it helps users discover new books tailored to their reading preferences.

## How It Works

The system employs **collaborative filtering** to analyze user behavior patterns:

1. **Data Analysis** - Processes user ratings and book metadata from the Book Crossing dataset
2. **Similarity Calculation** - Uses cosine similarity to find books with similar rating patterns  
3. **Recommendation Generation** - Returns the 5 most similar books when you select a title
4. **Visual Presentation** - Displays recommendations with book covers and metadata

<Note>
The system focuses on finding books that users with similar tastes have enjoyed, making it particularly effective for discovering hidden gems and popular titles within your preferred genres.
