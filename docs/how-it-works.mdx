## System Overview

The Book Recommender System uses **collaborative filtering** to provide personalized book recommendations. Unlike content-based filtering that analyzes book features, our system identifies patterns in user behavior to suggest books that readers with similar tastes have enjoyed.

## üß† The Recommendation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Input">
    You select a book you've enjoyed from our database of 271,379 titles
    
    <img src="/frontend1.png" alt="Book Recommendations Display" />
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pattern Analysis">
    The system identifies users who also rated your selected book highly and analyzes their other book preferences
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Similarity Calculation">
    Using k-Nearest Neighbors with cosine similarity, the system finds the most similar books based on user rating patterns
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Recommendation Generation">
    The top 5 most similar books are selected and displayed with covers and metadata
  </Step>
</Steps>

## üîç Collaborative Filtering Explained

### What is Collaborative Filtering?

Collaborative filtering operates on a simple principle: **people who agreed in the past will agree in the future**. If you and another user both enjoyed the same books, you're likely to enjoy other books they liked too.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="User-Based CF" icon="users">
    Finds users with similar preferences and recommends books they liked
    
    *"Users like you also enjoyed these books"*
  </Card>
  <Card title="Item-Based CF" icon="book">
    Finds books similar to ones you've liked based on user rating patterns
    
    *"Books similar to your favorites"*
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Our system primarily uses **item-based collaborative filtering**, which tends to be more stable and provides better explanations for recommendations.

### The Math Behind It

#### 1. User-Item Matrix

First, we create a sparse matrix where:
- **Rows** represent books
- **Columns** represent users  
- **Values** represent ratings (1-10 scale)

```python path=null start=null
# Simplified matrix structure
user_item_matrix = [
    #     User1  User2  User3  User4
    Book1: [  5,    0,    8,    0  ],  # Harry Potter
    Book2: [  4,    7,    0,    9  ],  # Lord of the Rings  
    Book3: [  0,    6,    7,    8  ],  # 1984
]
```

#### 2. Similarity Calculation

We use **cosine similarity** to measure how similar books are based on user rating patterns:

<Note>
**Cosine Similarity Formula:**

For books A and B:
```
similarity(A, B) = (A ¬∑ B) / (||A|| √ó ||B||)
```

This measures the angle between rating vectors, focusing on patterns rather than absolute values.
</Note>

#### 3. k-Nearest Neighbors

The k-NN algorithm finds the k most similar books to your selection:

1. Calculate similarity scores between your book and all other books
2. Sort by similarity score (highest first)
3. Return the top k similar books (we use k=6, showing 5 recommendations)

## üìä Data Processing Pipeline

### Raw Data Sources

Our system processes data from the **Book Crossing Dataset**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="üìö Books Dataset (BX-Books.csv)">
    **271,379 books** with metadata:
    - ISBN (unique identifier)
    - Title and author information
    - Publication year and publisher
    - Image URLs for book covers
    
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Sample book record
    {
        "ISBN": "0195153448",
        "Book-Title": "Classical Mythology", 
        "Book-Author": "Mark P. O. Morford",
        "Year-Of-Publication": "2002",
        "Publisher": "Oxford University Press",
        "Image-URL-L": "http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0195153448.01.L.jpg"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="üë• Users Dataset (BX-Users.csv)">
    **278,858 users** with demographics:
    - User ID (unique identifier)
    - Age and location information
    - Used for filtering and analysis
    
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Sample user record  
    {
        "User-ID": "276725",
        "Age": "18",
        "Location": "albany, georgia, usa"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="‚≠ê Ratings Dataset (BX-Book-Ratings.csv)">
    **1,149,780 ratings** connecting users to books:
    - User-ID and ISBN pairs
    - Ratings from 0-10 (0 = implicit feedback)
    - Forms the core interaction data
    
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Sample rating record
    {
        "User-ID": "276725", 
        "ISBN": "0195153448",
        "Book-Rating": "8"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Quality Filtering

To ensure recommendation quality, we apply strict filtering criteria:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Book Popularity Filter" icon="star">
    **50+ ratings minimum**
    
    Books must have at least 50 ratings to ensure statistical significance and avoid recommending obscure titles
  </Card>
  <Card title="User Activity Filter" icon="user-check">
    **200+ ratings minimum**
    
    Only users with 200+ ratings are included to ensure meaningful preference patterns
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This filtering reduces the dataset size but dramatically improves recommendation quality:

- **Books**: 271,379 ‚Üí ~11,000 (high-quality subset)
- **Users**: 278,858 ‚Üí ~900 (active users)
- **Ratings**: 1,149,780 ‚Üí ~433,000 (quality interactions)

### Model Training Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Loading & Cleaning">
    ```python path=/C/Users/Nirav/Desktop/rs project/Books-Recommender-System/Books Recommender.ipynb start=44
    books = pd.read_csv('data/BX-Books.csv', sep=";", error_bad_lines=False, encoding='latin-1')
    ```
    
    - Load CSV files with proper encoding
    - Handle malformed rows and missing data
    - Standardize column names and formats
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Filtering & Aggregation">
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Filter popular books (50+ ratings)
    popular_books = ratings.groupby('ISBN').count()['Book-Rating'] >= 50
    
    # Filter active users (200+ ratings) 
    active_users = ratings.groupby('User-ID').count()['Book-Rating'] >= 200
    ```
    
    Apply popularity and activity filters to create high-quality subset
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Matrix Creation">
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Create user-item pivot table
    book_pivot = final_rating.pivot_table(
        index='title', 
        columns='user_id', 
        values='rating'
    ).fillna(0)
    ```
    
    Transform data into sparse matrix format for similarity calculations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Model Training">
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Train k-NN model with cosine similarity
    model = NearestNeighbors(
        algorithm='brute', 
        metric='cosine'
    )
    model.fit(book_pivot)
    ```
    
    Train the nearest neighbors model for fast similarity searches
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Model Persistence">
    ```python path=null start=null
    # Save trained components
    pickle.dump(model, open('artifacts/model.pkl', 'wb'))
    pickle.dump(book_names, open('artifacts/book_names.pkl', 'wb'))
    ```
    
    Serialize models and data for fast loading in the web application
  </Step>
</Steps>

## üöÄ Real-time Recommendation Generation

When you select a book in the web interface:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Book Lookup">
    ```python path=/C/Users/Nirav/Desktop/rs project/Books-Recommender-System/app.py start=37
    def recommend_book(book_name):
        books_list = []
        book_id = np.where(book_pivot.index == book_name)[0][0]
    ```
    
    Find the book's index in our processed dataset
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Similarity Search">
    ```python path=/C/Users/Nirav/Desktop/rs project/Books-Recommender-System/app.py start=40
    distance, suggestion = model.kneighbors(book_pivot.iloc[book_id,:].values.reshape(1,-1), n_neighbors=6 )
    ```
    
    Use k-NN to find the 6 most similar books (including the selected book)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Metadata Retrieval">
    ```python path=/C/Users/Nirav/Desktop/rs project/Books-Recommender-System/app.py start=17
    def fetch_poster(suggestion):
        book_name = []
        ids_index = []
        poster_url = []
        
        for book_id in suggestion:
            book_name.append(book_pivot.index[book_id])
    ```
    
    Retrieve book covers and metadata for display
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Result Presentation">
    The top 5 similar books (excluding the input) are displayed with:
    - Book titles
    - Cover images
    - Organized in a clean grid layout
  </Step>
</Steps>

## üéØ Why This Approach Works

### Limitations & Considerations

<Warning>
**Cold Start Problem**: New books or users without sufficient data receive poor recommendations.

**Popularity Bias**: Popular books dominate recommendations, potentially missing niche gems.

**Sparsity**: Most user-book combinations have no ratings, creating a sparse matrix challenge.
</Warning>

## üß™ Example Walkthrough

Let's trace through a real recommendation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Input: '1984' by George Orwell">
    You select this classic dystopian novel
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="System finds users who rated '1984' highly">
