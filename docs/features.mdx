## Core Features

The Book Recommender System provides a comprehensive set of features designed to deliver accurate, personalized book recommendations through advanced machine learning techniques.

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Recommendations

### Collaborative Filtering Algorithm

Our system uses **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** with **cosine similarity** to find books that users with similar tastes have enjoyed.
