## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+** (3.9+ recommended)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **pip** for package management

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MELLOxProg/Books-Recommender-System.git
    cd Books-Recommender-System
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Virtual Environment">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="venv">
        ```bash
        python -m venv book-recommender
        # Windows
        book-recommender\Scripts\activate
        # macOS/Linux
        source book-recommender/bin/activate
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="conda">
        ```bash
        conda create -n book-recommender python=3.9
        conda activate book-recommender
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    This installs:
    - `streamlit` - Web application framework
    - `numpy` - Numerical computing
    - Local package dependencies
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Model Files">
    Ensure the model artifacts are present:
    ```bash
    ls artifacts/
    # Should show: model.pkl, book_names.pkl, book_pivot.pkl, final_rating.pkl
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      If model files are missing, you'll need to run the Jupyter notebook to generate them first.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch the Application">
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    
    The application will start and automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## First Use

Once the application is running:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Book">
    Use the dropdown menu to type or select a book you've enjoyed. The system contains thousands of popular titles.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get Recommendations">
    Click the "Show Recommendation" button to generate 5 personalized book suggestions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Explore Results">
    Browse the recommended books with their cover images. Each recommendation is based on similar user preferences.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'">
    **Solution**: Install the local package in editable mode:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="FileNotFoundError: artifacts/model.pkl">
    **Solution**: Generate the model files by running the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Books Recommender.ipynb"
    ```
    Execute all cells to create the required pickle files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Streamlit app won't start">
    **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit numpy
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Empty recommendations or errors">
    **Solution**: This usually indicates missing or corrupted model files. Re-run the training notebook to regenerate the artifacts.
