## Setup your environment

Get started with the Book Recommender System by setting up your local development environment.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prerequisites">
    - Python 3.7 or higher
    - Git for version control
    - Conda or pip for package management
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

<CodeGroup>

```bash Clone with Git
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-recommender-system.git
cd book-recommender-system
```

```bash Download ZIP
# Download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it
# Navigate to the extracted directory
cd book-recommender-system
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Create Environment

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Conda">
    ```bash
    conda create -n books python=3.7.10 -y
    conda activate books
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="venv">
    ```bash
    python -m venv books
    # On Windows
    books\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux  
    source books/bin/activate
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<Note>
  The requirements.txt includes all necessary packages: Streamlit, NumPy, and the local package installation.
</Note>

### Step 4: Generate Model Files

The system requires pre-trained model artifacts. If they're not included, run the Jupyter notebook to generate them:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Books Recommender.ipynb"
```

This will create the following files in the `artifacts/` directory:
- `model.pkl` - Trained k-NN model
- `book_names.pkl` - List of available book titles
- `book_pivot.pkl` - User-item interaction matrix
- `final_rating.pkl` - Processed ratings data

### Step 5: Launch the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will start and automatically open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Using the System

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Book">
    Use the dropdown menu to type or select a book you've enjoyed. The system contains thousands of popular titles.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Recommendations">
    Click the "Show Recommendation" button to generate 5 personalized book suggestions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore Results">
    Browse the recommended books with their cover images. Each recommendation is based on similar user preferences.
  </Step>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'">
    Make sure you've installed the package in editable mode:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="FileNotFoundError: artifacts/model.pkl">
    The model files need to be generated. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Books Recommender.ipynb"
    ```
    Execute all cells to create the required pickle files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Streamlit app won't start">
    Ensure all dependencies are installed and you're in the correct directory:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit numpy
    cd path/to/book-recommender-system
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Empty recommendations or errors">
    This usually indicates missing or corrupted model files. Re-run the training notebook to regenerate the artifacts.
